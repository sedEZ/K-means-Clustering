# K-means-Clustering
Implement K-means clustering , and compare the performance to sklearn.cluster.KMeans().

I write it as an object that you can easily use it.

## Data Preprocessing
 I need your help for 3 settings:
 
 - data_x : The table consists of all the feature that to be train.
            It's format should be "pandas.DataFrame".   
         
 - data_y : The table consists of all the feature that to be train.
            It's format should be "numpy.array".        
         
 - Simulate_time : The # of times you want to run for. 
 
 Note: Sorry but only numbers available:(

## Performance
print(result.acc) for checking average accuracy!

## Compate with sklearn.cluster.k_means_sklearn
At the end of the code, I run sklearn.cluster.KMeans and checks its accuracy.

The functions used on it are the same with functions used in class "our_k_means".

(To postprocess the clustering, like calculate mass & relabel)
